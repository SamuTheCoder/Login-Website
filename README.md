# Login-Website
A (very simple) login website made to train my html/css/js abilities
Based on a YT tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkxA6m-NNCY) , but I tried to add new stuff, like the fact that I used FlexBox to make the site responsive (not sure if it's perfectly used, but when I tested it was responsive)
