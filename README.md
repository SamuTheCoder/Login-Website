# Login-Website
A (very simple) login website made to train my html/css/js abilities.
  Based on a YT tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkxA6m-NNCY) , but I tried to add new stuff, like the fact that I used FlexBox to make the site responsive (I guess it was the only thing I managed to do differently, the rest is pretty much the same with some color/background changes)
